UBC Agrobot is an engineering student design team that competes in the International Field Robot Event (FRE) competition. With the emphasis on sustainability, our team develops an autonomous robot utilizing AI and machine learning for precise intra-row weeding and data collection. It identifies and eliminates weeds without harming crops, reducing the need for chemical pesticides. Additionally, the robot collects data on crop health to help farmers make better, more informed decisions.
